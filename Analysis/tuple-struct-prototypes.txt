how to find out which cluster contains the point which is closest to any arbitrary point?
--> find the closest point within each cluster to that point, find the distance and compare with every other cluster


how to find out which point within a cluster is nearest to any arbitrary point?
--> find the direction towards that point from the centerpoint
--> find the point farthest from the center in that general direction
--> find the points in the cluster nearest to the vector from the centerpoint to the arbitrary point (radially)
