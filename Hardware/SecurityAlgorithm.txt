Detection of movement throughout the house:

	Motion sensors can be used in conjunction with the detection of door open and close events to detect the likelihood of someone
	leaving or entering the home. Using this data a tally of all the entires into the home along with the number of motion detection
	events within a one hour period can be used to accurately predict occupancy along with a rough prediction of the location of the
	occupants.
	
Intelligent Algorithm for occupancy prediction:
 
	Using data from all the Door, Window and motion sensors along with data collected about the movement throughout the house an algorithm
	can be created to accurately predict the possibility of entry or exit.
